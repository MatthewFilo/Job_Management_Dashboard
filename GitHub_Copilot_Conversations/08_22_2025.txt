08/22/2025 – Session summary

Updates implemented
- Job creation success feedback: Added success Snackbar in App.tsx that shows “Job "<name>" created”.
- Delete success feedback: Show success Snackbar “Job "<name>" deleted” after successful deletion and page repopulation.
- Refresh UX: Added full-screen Backdrop with spinner when clicking Refresh; later reverted per request to use button fill feedback, then reverted again on request back to Backdrop overlay.
- Pagination tests fix: Removed role="button" from JobCard Paper to prevent duplicate Playwright button counts; this addressed failing pagination tests.

Context from earlier work (already in repo)
- Cursor pagination aligned with DRF CursorPagination (uses ?cursor and page_size), with client helpers ensurePageSize/toRelativeCursorPath.
- React Query caching: Prefetch next/prev pages; reuse cached pages for snappier navigation.
- Search: Case-insensitive prefix search with DB functional index on lower(name) and DRF filtering.
- Job Detail page and history endpoint integrated; cards navigate to detail while ignoring select/delete clicks.
- Redis caching with epoch-based invalidation across list/detail/history; backend increments epoch on mutations.

Troubleshooting
- Ubuntu VM make test: docker.errors.DockerException due to Permission denied on /var/run/docker.sock. Guidance provided to start Docker, add user to docker group, or use docker compose v2 via DC override.

Notes
- No code changes requested for the Ubuntu VM error.
- Current file of interest: frontend/src/App.tsx with Snackbar feedback and Backdrop on refresh.

Selected conversation snippets
- User: "Can we have a snackbar popup whenever we successfully create a new job"
  Copilot: "Added a success Snackbar on job creation."
- User: "Also create a snackbar popup for if we successfully delete a job"
  Copilot: "Added a success Snackbar on job deletion."
- User: "Running Playwright pagination test: expected 15 delete buttons, received 30"
  Copilot: "Removed role=\"button\" from the JobCard container to avoid duplicate accessible buttons."
- User: "I tried cloning the project in a ubuntu virtual machine and got docker.errors.DockerException Permission denied when running make test"
  Copilot: "Docker daemon not accessible; start Docker, add user to the docker group, or use docker compose v2."
- User: "Make the search feature non case sensitive."
  Copilot: "Switched filtering to annotate(Lower('name')) and use name_lower__startswith; added a functional index on lower(name) with text_pattern_ops for efficient prefix scans."
- User: "Next is not working."
  Copilot: "Aligned with DRF CursorPagination by using the ?cursor= param in cache keys and client navigation; introduced toRelativeCursorPath() and react-query prefetch of next/previous; corrected list cache key normalization to include cursor and page_size."
- User: "Implement a cache (thinking Redis)."
  Copilot: "Configured django-redis CACHES, added epoch-based invalidation key, cached list/detail/history with short TTLs; incremented epoch on create/update/delete and cleared per-job caches."
- User: "Updated: field is producing the same time as created."
  Copilot: "Ensured updated_at is saved when status changes by including it in update_fields inside set_job_status()."
- User: "Reverse the order of the status history (current at the top)."
  Copilot: "History endpoint returns results in reverse chronological order; UI shows current first."
- User: "Make the whole job card clickable, except status select and trash icon."
  Copilot: "Made the card navigate on click; added stopPropagation on the MUI Select and the delete IconButton; later removed role=\"button\" from the card to avoid Playwright double-counting accessible buttons."
- User: "Conflicting migrations detected: multiple leaf nodes (0002 ...)."
  Copilot: "Added a merge migration 0003_merge to resolve the conflict between two 0002 migrations; re-ran migrate successfully."
- User: "It pushed /frontend as a submodule, how do I clear that up?"
  Copilot: "Removed submodule config (.gitmodules and .git/config), git rm --cached frontend, deleted .git/modules/frontend and frontend/.git, git add frontend, commit, and push to make it a regular directory."
- User: "How to properly push to a new git repository?"
  Copilot: "git remote add origin <url>; git push -u origin main; verify CI and submodules are not present."
- User: "Ensure consistent page size in pagination."
  Copilot: "Frontend enforces page_size=15 via ensurePageSize(); backend CursorPagination page_size is 15—kept consistent with tests and UI."

- User: "Have the background fill in whenever we click on the refresh button."
  Copilot: "Added Backdrop overlay."
- User: "Undo that prompt, I meant the actual Refresh button fill with primary while pressed, then back."
  Copilot: "Switched to button color/variant state during async refresh."
- User: "Reverse the order of the status history (current at the top)."
  Copilot: "Updated backend history to reverse chronological and UI to show newest first."
- User: "Running Playwright test shows 30 delete buttons, not 15."
  Copilot: "Removed role=button from the JobCard container; only the IconButton remains discoverable by ARIA role."
- User: "Next is not working."
  Copilot: "Fixed server and client alignment with DRF CursorPagination by: (1) using the ?cursor param in cache keys, (2) normalizing absolute/relative cursors via toRelativeCursorPath, (3) prefetching next/previous with React Query, and (4) enforcing page_size consistently."
- User: "Make the search feature non case sensitive."
  Copilot: "Implemented case‑insensitive prefix search using annotate(Lower('name')) + name_lower__startswith and added a functional index on lower(name) with text_pattern_ops to preserve prefix index scans at scale."
- User: "Updated: field is producing the same time as created."
  Copilot: "Ensured updated_at is written on status transitions by including it in update_fields inside a transactional service layer method."
